## Development Plan
- The first sprint used a simple HTML document running JavaScript for logic. 
- For the second sprint it was a discussion between [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/), with the ultimate decision being Angular, as Moses had used this before, and was confident he could mentor the frontend devlopment team to achieve a solution.
    - The advantages of this solution is that our backend devlopment team don't need to learn Angular and can code in pure JavaScript.
    - This can be automatically tested on push, using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and then using continous deployment we can automatically upload this to the webspace. 

## Conflict Resolution Plan
- Reaction to work slipping / not going to schedule
    - Tasks will be set via the [Project Camban board](https://github.com/users/Jcorb08/projects/1), and will be moved along as they are completed.
    - Discussion needs to be had with team member as to current status, what seems to be the problem, and what help they need from us. 
        - If problem persists and it is starting to affect grade, a different task more adequent to the team members skills will be issued and the task will be rescheduled to a new team member. 
        - If the team member is not responding to any discussion after an adequate amount of time (1 week), then the assumption will be made that they have dropped out of the group.
- If a member of the group drops out (illness etc.)
    - The group member's tasks need to be assessed as to who best to reassign these to, and now that the workload is heavier on the rest of the group ensure that each member is not overwhelmed with the amount of work they now have. If this is the case those particular tasks need to be scheduled to a member who has more time.
