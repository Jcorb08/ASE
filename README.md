## Development Plan
- Currently using a simple HTML document running JavaScript for logic. 
- Later plans are to Learn and Implement the project using [React](https://reactjs.org/), as we can build from underlying code

## Conflict Resolution Plan
- Reaction to work slipping / not going to schedule
    - Discussion needs to be had with team member as to current status, what seems to be the problem, and what help they need from us. 
        - If problem persists and it is starting to affect grade, a different task more adequent to the team members skills will be issued and the task will be rescheduled to a new team member. 
        - If the team member is not responding to any discussion after an adequate amount of time (1 week), then the assumption will be made that they have dropped out of the group.
- If a member of the group drops out (illness etc.)
    - The group member's tasks need to be assessed as to who best to reassign these to, and now that the workload is heavier on the rest of the group ensure that each member is not overwhelmed with the amount of work they now have. If this is the case those particular tasks need to be scheduled to a member who has more time.
